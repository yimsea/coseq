Co-Expression Analysis of Sequencing Data

Gaussian and Poisson mixture models are implemented to cluster biological
entities (e.g., genes) from high-throughput sequencing data. Parameter estimation is
performed using the EM algorithm and model selection criteria (to choose the number of clusters) are 
provided.
