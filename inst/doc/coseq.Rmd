*coseq* is a package to perform clustering analysis of sequencing data (e.g., co-expression analysis 
of RNA-seq data). The package implements both Gaussian and Poisson mixtures model, performs 
parameter estimation using an expectation-maximization algorithm, and performs model selection 
using either the Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) criterion or the slope heuristics approach.

The full User's Guide for *coseq* may be found by installing the *coseq* package, loading it into an 
R session, and typing:
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(coseq)
coseqUsersGuide()
```
at the R prompt to open the User's Guide in a pdf viewer.
